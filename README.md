My second 2D game, inspired by the example game in "Unity in Action" from Joseph Hocking, developed with less than 1 month of Unity experience.
Extensions from the example are:
- The ability to choose difficulty levels.
- Background music and SFX.
- Card flipping animations.
- Tracking of both turns and scoring.
- A miriad of different creative common card decks. A basic learning of GIMP allowed me to resize the cards for my needs.
